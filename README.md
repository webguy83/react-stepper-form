## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)


### Continued development

Likely look into adding animations in the future in a more complex form although for such a basic form it's not needed.
